            What is a chemical reaction? A chemical reaction is when two or more substances react to produce 
            a new substance. The substances which react are called the reactants and the new substance formed
            is called the product. Dilution is to reduce to concentration of a liquid by mixing it with another
            liquid.

            Metals and Non-Metals
        </h4>
        <p>
            Metals lose electrons to make a positive charge, non-metals gain electrons to make a negative charge,
            and non-metals share electrons. When a metal gives electron(s) to a non-metal, this is called an ionic
            bond and the two elements are called ions. When non-metals share electrons to fill their outer electron
            shells, it is called a covalent bond. Ionic compound properties are: They are solid at room temperature,
            they have a very high melting point and they conduct electricity when they are melted or dissolved in water.
            Covalent compund properties are: Relatively low melting point, solid, liquid or gas at room temperature,
            and they don not conduct electricitywhen thry are melted or dissolved in water.

        <h4>
            Naming Ionic and Covalent Compounds
        </h4>
        <p>
            To name an ionic compound, you need to put the name of the metal first and then put the name of 
            the non-metal with the last three letters changed to "ide". For example, a bond between Calcium and 
            Chlorine would be Calcium Chloride. To name a covalent compound you need to look at the subscript of
            each element and put that number in words in front of the element. Add ide to the last three letters 
            of the second element. For example, CO2 would be monocarbon dioxide.

            Different Reactions
        </h4>
        <p>
            Synthesis Reaction is when two reactants combine and make a new substance. Decomposition reaction
            is when a compund breaks down into two or more simpler compounds or elements. Single displacement
            reaction is when one element takes the place of another element in a compound. Double displacement 
            reaction is when the metal ions of two different compounds exchange places. Neutralization(shown below)
             is when an acid is mixed with a base to create salt and water.
