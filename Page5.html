            How does Light Travel<!--Subtitle-->
        </h4>
        <p>
            Light travels through a medium in straight lines. A medium is any substance through which energy 
            can be transferred. There is also radiation which is a method of energy transfer without the need 
            of a medium. An electromagnetic wave is a wave which has both electric and magnetic properties. It 
            does not require a medium either. Light is produced from all things you see. Luminous means that it 
            produces its own light and non-luminous means it doesn’t produce light. Light bulbs are a source of 
            artificial light and there are many types of them. Incandescent light bulbs produce light as a result 
            of high temperatures. Light made by a process called electric discharge is produced by passing an 
            electric current through a gas. A fluorescent light bulb(shown below) makes light by an electric 
            discharge exciting the mercury atoms which then release UV light and that turns into visible light 
            when it hits the side of the tube. A LED(Light Emitting Diode) is the light produced as a result of 
            an electric current flowing through semiconductors

        <p>
            Mirrors use the property of reflection which is a change in the direction of a light ray, to create 
            an image. A few terms to remember are: normal which is a line perpendicular to a surface, incident ray 
            which is the ray of light travelling towards a surface, reflected ray which is the ray formed when the 
            incident ray meets the normal, the angle of incidence is the angle between the normal and the incident 
            ray, the angle of reflection is the angle between the normal and the reflected ray. According to the law
             of reflection it says: the normal, incident ray and reflected ray should be in the same plane and the 
             angle of incidence must equal the angle of reflection.<!--body-->

        <h4>
            Different Types of Mirrors<!--Subtitle-->
        </h4>
        <p>
            There are many types of mirrors as you may have seen in a fun house. There is the plane mirror 
            which is a regular flat mirror, there is a concave mirror which has the reflective surface curved
             inwards, and there is the convex mirrors which have the reflective surface curved outwards. 
             Images are formed when light rays meet and there are two types of images. There is the virtual 
             image in which it seems as if the light rays are meeting but they actually aren’t. There is a real
            image where the light rays are actually meeting. All images formed on a plane mirror, convex mirror
            and beyond some point on a concave mirror will be virtual. Images formed on a concave mirror when 
            the object is more than a certain distance(focal point) will be real. Also, all real images will be
            inverted. There are also a few formulas used to calculate the distance and height of the object, 
            its image, the magnification and the focal length which is half of the distance between the mirror
            and the center of the mirror(Center of Curvature). The mirror equation is <strong>1/f = 1/di + 1/do</strong> where 
            f is the focal length, di is the distance to the image and do is the distance to the object. The 
            second equation known as the magnification equation is <strong><!--Makes font bolder-->m = hi/ho = -di/do</strong> where m is the 
            magnification, hi is the height of the image and ho is the height of the object.
