            Microscopes
        </h4>
        <p>
            There are many microscopes in the modern world. Some of them are : Leeuwenhoek Microscope which magnifies 
            up to 250 times and it is handheld, Brightfield/Darkfield Microscope which magnifies up to 2000 times, 
            Fluorescence Microscope magnifies up to 1500 times, Transmission Electron Microscope(shown below) magnifies up to 
            1 000 000 times, Scanning Electron Microscope magnifies up to 200 000 times and many more.

            Cell Structure
        </h4>
        <p>
            The cell is made up of a few parts which are: cell membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondria, ribosomes,
            endoplasmic reticulum, vesicles, golgi body, nucleus, vacuoles, cytoskeleton, cell wall and chloroplasts.
            All of these have specific functios will help with keeping the cell alive. The cell theory states that:
            All living organsims are made up of one or more cells, The cell is the basic organizational unit of life,
            and All cells come from pre-existing cells.

            Cell Division
        </h4>
        <p>
            All cells divide to make more cells. There is a specific order in which the cells divide. First, 
            there is Interphase where the cells grows and replicates it's parts like the chromosomes. Then, 
            there is prophase where the cells are in prophase where spindle fibers form from centrosomes, the nucleolus dissppears and
            the the chromosomes condense to be visible under a microscope. Next is Metaphase where the spindle
            fibers attach themsleves to the centromere at the center of the chromosomes and all the chromosomes
            line up at the center of the cell. Fourth, there is Anaphase where the spindle fibers put to make
            chromatids from the chromosomes. After that, there is Telophase where the spindle fibers start to 
            disappear, the nucleolus reappears and the chromosomes become less coiled so it is harder to see them.
            Lastly, there is cytokinesis where the cell membrane pinches in and to daughter cells are formed.
