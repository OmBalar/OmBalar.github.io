            The Basics
        </h4>
        <p>
            The earth is surrounded by a layer of gases called the atmosphere. The conditions of the atmosphere
            at a specific place and time is called weather whereas climate is the pattern of weather over a long
            period of time such as 30 years. As a result of climate change, earth's average temperature went up 
            which is called global warming.

        <h4>
            The Sun and the Earth
        </h4>
        <p>
            Since the Earth is curved, some places get more concentrated sunlight then other places and that
            makes places like the equator warmer than the poles. The Earth's tilt also causes seasons because 
            at times the earth is tilted towrds the sun or it is tilted away from the sun causing the sun to
            give more or less light to the area which is affected by the tilt. The Earth's orbit also affects 
            it's temperature because the Earth is closer to the sun at some parts of it's orbit.

        <h4>
            Different Climates
        </h4>
        <p>
            There are grpahs called climatographs which show the average temperature of an area and the 
            monthly precipitation. The Koppen Climate Classification System divides the world into five parts 
            based on average montly temperature, average monthly precipitation, and average annual precipitation.
            Biomes divide the world into 8 sections based on the biotic and abiotic conditions. Biomes are
            further divides into Ecozones which shows the geographical feature of a region. Then there are 
            Ecoregions which show the local landforms of a region.

        <h4>
            Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming
        </h4>
        <p>
            There are many greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which are natural and we are adding to them.
            Most of the atmosphere is made of Nitrogen gas(78%) and Oxygen(21%) but there are other gases like
            Carbon Dioxide and CFC's(chloroflorocarbons) which can cause lots of damage even with very small 
            amounts.
